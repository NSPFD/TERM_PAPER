OpenFermion provides connectivity to the open source libraries for quantum chemical calculations Psi4 and PySCF. Even if you do not understand the details of how to use these libraries, you can obtain the Hamiltonian of the electron system that appears in quantum chemical calculations simply by entering the structure of the molecule. Here, we use PySCF."
