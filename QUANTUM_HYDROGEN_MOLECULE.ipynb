        "In this chapter, we introduce a method to convert the Hamiltonian of an interacting electron system into a form that is easy for quantum computers to handle using OpenFermion[1], a python library for quantum chemistry calculation. OpenFermion provides connectivity to the open source libraries for quantum chemical calculations Psi4 and PySCF. Even if you do not understand the details of how to use these libraries, you can obtain the Hamiltonian of the electron system that appears in quantum chemical calculations simply by entering the structure of the molecule. Here, we use PySCF."
